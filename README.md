Feed Reader
===========
RSS is a [standard protocol](http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html) that operates over [http](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt) and is commonly used to publish updates for resources including blogs, news sites, and many more. It is based in [XML](http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/) and designed to be easily read by programs.

Your task is to create such a program.

Basics
======
Your program must be able to perform the following basic tasks:

1. Accept user defined feeds.
1. Read those feeds and store the data incrementally (preferrably in a database)
1. Track additional information related to feed items (such as whether they have been read or not)
1. Display a list of feed items
1. Display a detail view for an individual item (and track the view)

This project is designed to be implementable in nearly any programming language; however, it may be easiest to implement it as a web application to leverage knowledge of langauges you already know. If you do not want to write it in PHP then the following languages are suggested:

* Web
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - Javascript on the server
  * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (on [rails](http://rubyonrails.org/))
  * [Hack](http://hacklang.org/) (a facebook derivative of PHP)
  * Java ([Spring](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/), or similar framework)
  * C# ([MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc))


* Desktop (difficult to develop a UI for)
  * C/C++
  * Java
  * C# (Windows)


* Mobile - native
  * [Android](http://developer.android.com/index.html) - Java
  * [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action) - Objective C / cocoa
  * [Windows Phone 8](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us) - C#


* Mobile - cross platform
  * [Phone Gap](http://phonegap.com/) - (HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  * [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com/) - C#

Your application will need to store data, it is reccommended you do it with a database. If you do not want to use MySQL the following database technologies are suggested:

* SQL
  * [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/)
  * [MSSQL](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/)
  * [Oracle DB](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/overview/index.html)


* [NoSQL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)
  * Object - Easiest
    * [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/)
    * [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/)
    * [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)
  * Key/Value - Hard
    * [Redis](http://redis.io/)
    * [LevelDB](https://code.google.com/p/leveldb/)
    * [Tokyo Cabinet](http://fallabs.com/tokyocabinet/) or [Kyoto Cabinet](http://fallabs.com/kyotocabinet/) (or their [network](http://fallabs.com/tokyotyrant/) [counterparts](http://fallabs.com/kyototycoon/))
  * Graph - Harder
    * [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/orientdb/)
    * [Neo4j](http://www.neo4j.org/)
    * [VertexDB](https://github.com/stevedekorte/vertexdb)


* File (not recommended)
  * JSON on disk
  * Flat file


Advanced
========
A project that performs all "Basic" actions will not impress a potential employer, what will is how you expand upon the project core, and make the idea your own. Below are some potential improvements/extensions to the core idea, or you may come up with your own.

###Display
* A clean elegant interface
* Single page app

###Social network integration
This involves adding functionality by leveraging existing networks (facebook, twitter, etc.) to create some functionality
* Share to social networks
* Pull friends and interests

###Discovery
These are all related to how your application can suggest feeds to a user
* Social network (Add friends, recommend feeds your friends like)
* Tag based, categorize different feeds by tags
* Content matching/indexing
* Recommend feeds you don't follow that other users that follow same/similar feeds do

###Organization
These are all related to how you choose to organize and/or filter feed entries
* Natural language analysis
  * Sentiment analysis (do you want to read happy, sad, etc. feed items)
  * Summary analysis
    * Hide similar stories
    * Show the most different stories first
* Vote based
* User interest based (weighted tags on feeds)

###Various
* Read [atom](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt)
* Publish a combined feed (in multiple formats)
* Read and publish using [PubSubHubbub](https://code.google.com/p/pubsubhubbub/)
* Make your application usable via an API with [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
